# Chord 123

This project is a web app that I made to help out a friend who's had trouble transposing chord sheets between keys, and numbers. This project is hosted on firebase on https://chord-123.firebaseapp.com

This repository stores the React code for the app. The app communicates to a flask server that has been hosted on heroku.
